[@kraykray](http://twitter.com/kraykray) was nice enough to let me know that Rails 3.03 had broken my column-reader code.

I've always seen it as a toy rather than a serious project, but getting a bug report made me re-evaluate.  If people are using it, even a tiny piece of code like this deserves a proper home.

So here it is, as both [a github repository](https://github.com/tomafro/rails-activerecord-columnreader) and [a gem](http://rubygems.org/gems/activerecord-column-reader).  Enjoy!
