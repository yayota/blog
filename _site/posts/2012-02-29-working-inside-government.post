Since September, I and the other [Go Free Range](http://gofreerange.com) guys have been working for the government.  We've been helping the able and growing [Government Digital Service](http://digital.cabinetoffice.gov.uk/) to build [whitehall](https://github.com/alphagov/whitehall), our code name for the [Inside Government section of gov.uk](https://www.gov.uk/government).  Yesterday we removed the password and opened our doors to the public.

For those who don't know, [gov.uk](https://www.gov.uk) is the UK government's attempt to not only consolidate government websites to a single domain, but also build these sites in the right way.  That means [public](https://www.pivotaltracker.com/projects/367813), [open source](https://github.com/alphagov/whitehall), continual delivery and more.

While the first part of [gov.uk](https://www.gov.uk) focussed on helping citizens, [Inside Government](https://www.gov.uk/government) is about the business of government.  [What policies](https://www.gov.uk/government/policy-topics) the government has, [how it's implementing them](https://www.gov.uk/government/policies/launching-the-single-domain), not to mention the [news and speeches](https://www.gov.uk/government/news-and-speeches), [publications](https://www.gov.uk/government/publications), [consultations](https://www.gov.uk/government/consultations) and other things the government does each day.

It's only the first release of many, a small glimpse into what will one day be.  How it ends up will be shaped by [feedback from the people who use it](https://www.gov.uk/feedback).}
