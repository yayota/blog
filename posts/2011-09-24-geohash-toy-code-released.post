A couple of weeks ago I [wrote about a small toy app](http://tomafro.net/2011/09/a-small-toy-to-explore-geohashes) I'd written to explore geohashes.  Now I've cleaned the code up a little, upgraded it to rails 3.1 and released it [here on github](https://github.com/tomafro/geohash-explorer).  Enjoy.
